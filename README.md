Like farmville, but actually good (hopefully)

Status: Works but needs polish/tweaking

Pros:
+ doesn't use flash
+ no need to pay or share with friends for accelerated growth
+ works for mobile(kinda)
+ doesn't use flash

Cons:
- ðŸ¤”usesðŸ¤”emojisðŸ¤”forðŸ¤”spritesðŸ¤”

How to run:
Copy/clone game directory onto your pc, and run the index.html file.
If you're running linux you might want to install something like emojione so the icons don't suck.
